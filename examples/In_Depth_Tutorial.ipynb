    "You can move the robot arm using either global cartesian coordinates or joint angles. Both systems have advantages and disadvantages. Specifying global coordinates is certainly easier to use and will require less work. However, by only specifying the position of the end effector you are leaving the specific pose of the arm up to the IK solver (inverse kinematic solver). By default, the IK solver will find the pose closest to the arms current position. There are instances when this might not give you the desired pose and at that point you should specify the position using `move_joints`. Additionaly, using `move_joints` allows you to create isolated movements like panning the robot left or right or rotating the wrist."
