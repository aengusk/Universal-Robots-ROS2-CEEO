    "The MyUR3e class has a function called move_global() that we will use to move the arm. This allows us to tell the arm where in 3D space we want the end effector to be. Inside of the MyUR3e class, we take these values and compute the angles of all six joints so that the end effector is exactly at that position. There is also a move_joints() function that gives you control over the angle of each joint, but using move_global is much easier! (If can code the end effector to move from in a line using the move_joints() function I will personally buy you a snack)."
