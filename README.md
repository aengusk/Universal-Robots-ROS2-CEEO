# MyUR3e ROS2 Python Control

## Overview

This repository contains Python scripts for controlling the Universal Robots UR3e robotic arm using ROS2. The main component is the **MyUR3e** class, which provides functionalities to interface with the robot arm for tasks such as trajectory planning, gripper control, and accessing joint states and tool wrench data.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts in this repository, ensure you have the following installed:

- ROS2 Foxy (or a compatible version)
- Python 3.x (recommended: Python 3.8+)
- Necessary ROS2 packages for UR3e control and dependencies

* If you are running code from a JupyterHub then you can assume that these dependencies are already installed in your environment.
